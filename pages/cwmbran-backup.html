                    I'm back on the hill again, having scaled the treacherously slimy staircase 
                    to the decking, with a coffee and my mate Csopi. There are a few doves around,
                    spread out and enjoying their space, in the canopy of a true giant of a tree that 
                    may as well be half a forest.

                  I've been living in the Big Smoke for about half a year, and I really missed hanging out with neighbourhood cats, there weren't nearly as many around. All kinds of memories started coming back from where I left off, like refilling the bird (squirrel) feeder every morning from a bag of peanuts the size of a small fridge, checking the window every time I dropped by the kitchen for something to see if Csopi or one of the others showed up (Csopi was a vagrant back then, but owing to various territorial and power dynamic shifts has become a regular), etc.

                <p> Where do you end a blog post? If you promise yourself that you'll write another one soon, it becomes a less daunting q2uestion. On that note, thank you for reading, and see you soon. </p>
